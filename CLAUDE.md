### Feature Development Pattern

Each feature should follow the MVVM structure:

```
features/[feature_name]/
â”œâ”€â”€ models/           # Data models specific to the feature
â”œâ”€â”€ views/            # UI screens and widgets
â”œâ”€â”€ view_models/      # Business logic and state management
â””â”€â”€ services/         # Feature-specific services
```

### Firebase Configuration

#### Database Structure
```
firestore/
â”œâ”€â”€ businesses/{businessId}/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ info (business details)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ users/{userId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ products/{productId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ recipes/{recipeId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ingredients/{ingredientId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ suppliers/{supplierId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ purchases/{purchaseId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pricingHistory/{recordId}
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ reports/{reportId}
â””â”€â”€ sharedIngredients/ (common ingredients database)
```

#### Security Rules Template
```javascript
// Firestore Rules
match /businesses/{businessId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid in resource.data.authorizedUsers;
    
  match /{document=**} {
    allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
      request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/businesses/$(businessId)).data.authorizedUsers;
  }
}
```

## Core Features Roadmap

   - Email/password login with Firebase Auth
   - Route guards and session management
   - Portuguese error messages

2. **Ingredient Management** ðŸš§
   - CRUD operations with validation
   - Unit conversions (kgâ†”g, Lâ†”mL)
   - Supplier linking and price tracking

3. **Recipe Builder** ðŸ“‹
   - Ingredient quantities and steps
   - Yield calculation and cost auto-calculation
   - Recipe versioning and modification history

4. **Product Catalog** ðŸ“‹
   - Link to recipes with size variations
   - Categories matching current menus
   - Photo gallery and pricing rules

5. **Purchase Registry** ðŸ“‹
