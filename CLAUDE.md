The application follows a comprehensive design system with warm, professional aesthetics suitable for bakery businesses. For detailed design specifications, including:

- **Color Palettes**: Primary, secondary, semantic colors with accessibility guidelines
- **Typography**: Font families, scales, and usage guidelines  
- **Component Styles**: Buttons, forms, cards, and layout patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with consistent breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and inclusive design practices

**Refer to: [Design Guidelines](docs/design-guidelines.md)** for complete styling specifications.

### Development Process

This project follows a comprehensive development workflow optimized for LLM agents. For detailed guidelines including:

- **LLM Agent Persona**: Role definition, expertise areas, and decision-making authority
- **Code Standards**: SOLID, KISS, DRY, YAGNI principles with practical examples
- **Security-First Development**: Input validation, authentication, and data protection
- **File Organization**: Modularity guidelines, naming conventions, and structure patterns
- **Git Workflow**: Branch strategy, commit conventions, and quality gates
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, widget, and integration testing approaches

**Refer to: [Development Workflow](docs/development-workflow.md)** for complete development guidelines and standards.

### Feature Development Pattern

Each feature should follow the MVVM structure:

```
features/[feature_name]/
â”œâ”€â”€ models/           # Data models specific to the feature
â”œâ”€â”€ views/            # UI screens and widgets
â”œâ”€â”€ view_models/      # Business logic and state management
â””â”€â”€ services/         # Feature-specific services
```

### Firebase Configuration

#### Database Structure
```
firestore/
â”œâ”€â”€ businesses/{businessId}/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ info (business details)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ users/{userId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ products/{productId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ recipes/{recipeId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ingredients/{ingredientId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ suppliers/{supplierId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ purchases/{purchaseId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pricingHistory/{recordId}
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ reports/{reportId}
â””â”€â”€ sharedIngredients/ (common ingredients database)
```

#### Security Rules Template
```javascript
// Firestore Rules
match /businesses/{businessId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid in resource.data.authorizedUsers;
    
  match /{document=**} {
    allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
      request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/businesses/$(businessId)).data.authorizedUsers;
  }
}
```

## Feature Implementation Status

For detailed feature roadmap, timelines, and implementation phases, refer to **[Implementation Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)**.

### Current Status Summary
- **Phase 1 Foundation**: In progress (Authentication âœ…, Ingredient Management ðŸš§)
- **Firebase Services**: Needs console configuration
- **Next Priority**: Complete ingredient management system
- **Target MVP**: End of July 2025

## Business Logic Rules

### Pricing Guidelines
- **Minimum Margin**: 100% (2x ingredient cost)
- **Suggested Margin**: 150-200% depending on category
- **Premium Products**: 200-300% margin
- **Seasonal Adjustment**: +20-50% for holiday items

### Inventory Management
- **Perishables**: Alert 2 days before expiration
- **Reorder Point**: When stock < 2x weekly average usage
- **Waste Tracking**: Log expired/damaged items for cost analysis

### Recipe Scaling
- **Linear Scaling**: Most ingredients scale proportionally
- **Non-linear Items**: Yeast, salt, baking powder (use lookup tables)
- **Yield Variance**: Â±5% acceptable variance in production
