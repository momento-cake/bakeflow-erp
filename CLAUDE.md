### Development Workflow

#### Git Workflow
- **main**: Production-ready code, automatically deployed
- **feature/***: Feature development branches
- **hotfix/***: Critical production fixes
- Small, focused commits with descriptive messages
- Pull requests for code review before merging

#### Commit Conventions
```
feat: add ingredient management CRUD operations
fix: resolve authentication redirect loop
docs: update project structure documentation
style: apply consistent code formatting
refactor: extract common UI components
test: add unit tests for pricing calculator
```

#### Code Standards
- Follow Flutter/Dart conventions and best practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names in English
- Add Portuguese comments for business logic explanations
- Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Write unit tests for business logic and widget tests for UI

### Feature Development Pattern

Each feature should follow the MVVM structure:

```
features/[feature_name]/
â”œâ”€â”€ models/           # Data models specific to the feature
â”œâ”€â”€ views/            # UI screens and widgets
â”œâ”€â”€ view_models/      # Business logic and state management
â””â”€â”€ services/         # Feature-specific services
```

### Firebase Configuration

#### Database Structure
```
firestore/
â”œâ”€â”€ businesses/{businessId}/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ info (business details)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ users/{userId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ products/{productId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ recipes/{recipeId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ingredients/{ingredientId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ suppliers/{supplierId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ purchases/{purchaseId}
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pricingHistory/{recordId}
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ reports/{reportId}
â””â”€â”€ sharedIngredients/ (common ingredients database)
```

#### Security Rules Template
```javascript
// Firestore Rules
match /businesses/{businessId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid in resource.data.authorizedUsers;
    
  match /{document=**} {
    allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
      request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/businesses/$(businessId)).data.authorizedUsers;
  }
}
```

## Core Features Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP) âœ…

   - Email/password login with Firebase Auth
   - Route guards and session management
   - Portuguese error messages

2. **Ingredient Management** ðŸš§
   - CRUD operations with validation
   - Unit conversions (kgâ†”g, Lâ†”mL)
   - Supplier linking and price tracking

3. **Recipe Builder** ðŸ“‹
   - Ingredient quantities and steps
   - Yield calculation and cost auto-calculation
   - Recipe versioning and modification history

4. **Product Catalog** ðŸ“‹
   - Link to recipes with size variations
   - Categories matching current menus
   - Photo gallery and pricing rules

5. **Purchase Registry** ðŸ“‹
   - Manual entry forms with receipt tracking
   - Automatic ingredient price updates
   - Supplier management integration

6. **Pricing Calculator** ðŸ“‹

## Business Logic Rules

### Pricing Guidelines
- **Minimum Margin**: 100% (2x ingredient cost)
- **Suggested Margin**: 150-200% depending on category
- **Premium Products**: 200-300% margin
- **Seasonal Adjustment**: +20-50% for holiday items

### Inventory Management
- **Perishables**: Alert 2 days before expiration
- **Reorder Point**: When stock < 2x weekly average usage
- **Waste Tracking**: Log expired/damaged items for cost analysis

### Recipe Scaling
- **Linear Scaling**: Most ingredients scale proportionally
- **Non-linear Items**: Yeast, salt, baking powder (use lookup tables)
- **Yield Variance**: Â±5% acceptable variance in production
