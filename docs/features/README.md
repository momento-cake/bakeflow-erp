# BakeFlow ERP - Feature Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for individual features in the BakeFlow ERP system. Each feature is documented with complete implementation details, technical specifications, and deployment instructions optimized for LLM agent development.

## Documentation Structure

Each feature documentation includes:

- **Business Context**: User stories, requirements, and business value
- **Technical Specification**: Data models, architecture, and implementation plan
- **UI/UX Design**: Interface mockups, user flows, and design requirements
- **Security Implementation**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, widget, and integration testing approaches
- **Performance Considerations**: Optimization strategies and monitoring
- **Deployment Instructions**: Step-by-step deployment and rollback procedures
- **LLM Agent Context**: Implementation continuation points and troubleshooting

## Status Legend

- ✅ **Completed**: Feature implemented, tested, and deployed
- 🚧 **In Development**: Feature currently being implemented
- 📋 **Planned**: Feature documented and ready for implementation
- 🔄 **In Review**: Feature implemented and under review
- ⚠️ **Blocked**: Feature blocked by dependencies or issues
- 🔧 **Maintenance**: Feature in maintenance or bug-fix mode

## Documentation Template

Use the [Ingredient Management](ingredient-management.md) documentation as a template for creating new feature documentation. This template includes:

### Required Sections
1. **Feature Overview**: ID, name, priority, status, business context
2. **Technical Specification**: Data models, architecture, file structure
3. **Implementation Plan**: Phased development approach with priorities
4. **UI/UX Design**: Interface requirements and user experience
5. **Security Implementation**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
6. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing approach
7. **Performance Considerations**: Optimization and monitoring strategies
8. **Error Handling**: Error types, handling, and recovery procedures
9. **LLM Agent Context**: Implementation context and continuation points
10. **Deployment Instructions**: Step-by-step deployment and rollback

### Documentation Guidelines
- Use clear, structured YAML blocks for status and configuration
- Include complete Dart code examples for models and services
- Provide specific file paths and directory structures
- Document security rules and validation patterns
- Include comprehensive testing examples
- Add LLM-specific context for autonomous development
- Provide deployment and rollback procedures

## Feature Dependencies

### Common Dependencies
- **Authentication System**: Required for all features
- **Business Context Provider**: Multi-tenant data isolation
- **Error Handling System**: Consistent error management
- **Design System**: UI components and styling
- **State Management**: Riverpod providers and state handling
