## Goal
We will not allow account creation on the login flow, now we will create a role based access system that will allow us to display or not features based on the roles.
Admin users should be the only ones to be able to add new companies and users to that company, he must also be able to request reset password. When admins create new users it should send an email to the user with instructions to login or maybe create and use a temporary password that requires user to create a new one on the first login.
Follow the best practices for the Firebase Authentication flow
